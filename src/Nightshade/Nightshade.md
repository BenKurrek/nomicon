# Nightshade

**Nightshade** is the core algorithm of *NEAR-Blockchain* that allows a set of participants achieve consensus on byzantine environment. **Nightshade** tolerates up to 1 / 3 (not inclusive) of participants having byzantine behaviour.

## The Prototocol

**TODO** Technical explanation of nightshade.

### Byzantine behaviour

* Failing in unexpected ways. *This is not penalized*. It is expected that nodes go in-n-out of the network at will, and network failures might occur.
* Deviating from the protocol. *This should be penalized whenever detected and concrete evidence exists*.
